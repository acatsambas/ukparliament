        "detail": "The legislation prioritises inertia and defaults over active choice, notably through the automatic consolidation of small pots and 'contractual overrides' that allow providers to change terms or transfer members without specific consent. Furthermore, the 'guided retirement' provisions and mandates on asset allocation (pushing funds toward specific UK assets) reduce the purely market-driven autonomy of trustees and the individual choice of savers. These restrictions are justified by the policy view that member disengagement leads to suboptimal outcomes, necessitating systemic intervention."

The introduction of 'guided retirement' duties addresses a critical gap where retirees currently struggle to manage the drawdown of their savings, potentially reducing the risk of running out of money in old age. The expansion of terminal illness provisions also directly improves the quality of life for the dying by reducing financial stress."

It introduces significant reforms to local government governance, including the establishment of a Local Audit Office to oversee financial reporting, the reintroduction of the supplementary vote system for mayors, and new regulations for business tenancy rent reviews.

Part 5 significantly intervenes in the commercial property market by restricting 'upwards only' rent reviews that do not reflect market value; while this protects tenant businesses from artificial cost inflation, it may temporarily reduce yields and investment attractiveness for commercial landlords."

However, granting mayors enhanced borrowing powers and the ability to levy precepts (Part 1) will likely increase the overall tax burden on local residents and raise public sector debt levels, albeit at a local rather than national level.
